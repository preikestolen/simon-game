# simon-game
* The Simon Game is a classic memory and pattern recognition game that can improve short-term memory through repetitive and progressively challenging gameplay.
* In the game, players must follow and remember the color or sound sequence presented by the device.
* As the game progresses, the sequences increase in length and complexity, challenging the player to remember and accurately repeat the entire pattern.
* By Remembering and replaying Simon's sequences, the player's short-term memory stores and manipulates information.
* Success in the game is directly related to the player's ability to memorize and repeat increasingly longer and more complex patterns, which contributes to the development and improvement of short-term memory.
